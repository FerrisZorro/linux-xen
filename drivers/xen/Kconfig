config XEN_BALLOON
	bool "Xen memory balloon driver"
	depends on XEN
	default y
	help
	  The balloon driver allows the Xen domain to request more memory from
	  the system to expand the domain's memory allocation, or alternatively
	  return unneeded memory to the system.

config XEN_SCRUB_PAGES
	bool "Scrub pages before returning them to system"
	depends on XEN_BALLOON
	default y
	help
	  Scrub pages before returning them to the system for reuse by
	  other domains.  This makes sure that any confidential data
	  is not accidentally visible to other domains.  Is it more
	  secure, but slightly less efficient.
	  If in doubt, say yes.

config XEN_DEV_EVTCHN
	tristate "Xen /dev/xen/evtchn device"
	depends on XEN
	default y
	help
	  The evtchn driver allows a userspace process to triger event
	  channels and to receive notification of an event channel
	  firing.
	  If in doubt, say yes.

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND
	tristate "PCI-device backend driver"
	depends on PCI && XEN_BACKEND
	default XEN_BACKEND
	help
	  The PCI device backend driver allows the kernel to export arbitrary
	  PCI devices to other guests. If you select this to be a module, you
	  will need to make sure no other driver has bound to the device(s)
	  you want to make visible to other guests.

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_VPCI
	bool "Virtual PCI"
	---help---
	  This PCI Backend hides the true PCI topology and makes the frontend
	  think there is a single PCI bus with only the exported devices on it.
	  For example, a device at 03:05.0 will be re-assigned to 00:00.0. A
	  second device at 02:1a.1 will be re-assigned to 00:01.1.

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_PASS
	bool "Passthrough"
	---help---
	  This PCI Backend provides a real view of the PCI topology to the
	  frontend (for example, a device at 06:01.b will still appear at
	  06:01.b to the frontend). This is similar to how Xen 2.0.x exposed
	  PCI devices to its driver domains. This may be required for drivers
	  which depend on finding their hardward in certain bus/slot
	  locations.

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_SLOT
	bool "Slot"
	---help---
	  This PCI Backend hides the true PCI topology and makes the frontend
	  think there is a single PCI bus with only the exported devices on it.
	  Contrary to the virtual PCI backend, a function becomes a new slot.
	  For example, a device at 03:05.2 will be re-assigned to 00:00.0. A
	  second device at 02:1a.1 will be re-assigned to 00:01.0.

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_CONTROLLER
	bool "Controller"
	depends on IA64
	---help---
	  This PCI backend virtualizes the PCI bus topology by providing a
	  virtual bus per PCI root device.  Devices which are physically under
	  the same root bus will appear on the same virtual bus.  For systems
	  with complex I/O addressing, this is the only backend which supports
	  extended I/O port spaces and MMIO translation offsets.  This backend
	  also supports slot virtualization.  For example, a device at
	  0000:01:02.1 will be re-assigned to 0000:00:00.0.  A second device
	  at 0000:02:05.0 (behind a P2P bridge on bus 0000:01) will be
	  re-assigned to 0000:00:01.0.  A third device at 0000:16:05.0 (under
	  a different PCI root bus) will be re-assigned to 0000:01:00.0.

	  The xen filesystem provides a way for domains to share

	  For example, by reading and writing the "xenbus" file, guests

         The old xenstore userspace tools expect to find "xenbus"
         under /proc/xen, but "xenbus" is now found at the root of the
         xenfs filesystem.  Selecting this causes the kernel to create
         the compatibility mount point /proc/xen if it is running on
         a xen platform.
         If in doubt, say yes.
